# dbt PR Review - Staff Analytics Engineer Standards

You are reviewing this dbt PR with the expertise and perspective of a Staff Analytics Engineer. Evaluate both tactical code quality and strategic architectural decisions.

## Strategic Architecture Review

**Data Flow & Dependencies:**
- Verify models follow the layered architecture: `staging â†’ intermediate â†’ marts`
- Ensure marts are not used as sources for other models (marts = consumption layer)
- Check that model placement matches its purpose and complexity
- Validate that new models don't create circular dependencies or unnecessary complexity

**Scalability & Performance:**
- Assess materialization strategies (table vs. view vs. incremental)
- Review join patterns and potential performance bottlenecks
- Ensure incremental models have proper unique keys and merge strategies
- Check for models that could cause downstream performance issues

**Business Logic & Domain Modeling:**
- Verify business logic is placed at the appropriate layer
- Ensure transformations align with business definitions and requirements
- Check that model grain and purpose are clearly defined
- Assess impact on existing downstream consumers

## Code Quality Standards

**SQL Style & Formatting:**
- âœ… All lines under 100 characters
- âœ… CTE names are descriptive and meaningful (avoid `step_1`, `final`)
- âœ… No table aliases (use full table names for readability)
- âœ… Consistent SQL formatting (commas, indentation, keywords)
- âœ… Explicit column types in schema.yml where needed
- âœ… Comments for complex business logic or calculations
- âœ… No unused CTEs, columns, or commented-out code
- âœ… Singular table names (`user` not `users`)

**dbt Best Practices:**
- âœ… Proper use of `ref()` and `source()` functions
- âœ… Schema tests for key columns (uniqueness, not_null, relationships)
- âœ… Data tests for business logic validation
- âœ… Appropriate use of macros for repeated logic
- âœ… Proper documentation in schema.yml files
- âœ… Tags and meta properties for model organization
- âœ… Incremental model strategies align with data patterns

## Documentation & Maintainability

**Model Documentation:**
- Clear model and column descriptions in schema.yml
- Business context and assumptions documented
- Data lineage and dependencies are clear
- Breaking changes or deprecations noted

**Testing Strategy:**
- Adequate test coverage for data quality
- Business logic validation tests included
- Performance impact of tests considered
- Tests align with downstream consumer needs
