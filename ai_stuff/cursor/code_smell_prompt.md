Check this dbt model for code smells and best practices. Ensure:
- All lines are under 100 characters.
- CTE names are descriptive and meaningful.
- No table aliases are used.
- Use consistent SQL formatting.
- Use explicit column types where possible.
- Add comments for complex logic.
- No unused CTEs or columns.
- Use singular table names.
- Avoid commented out code.
Minimize any actual logic changes unless explicitly asked - primarily handle formatting and standardization/efficiency.
